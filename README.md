This C program is designed to read a line of user input and save it to a file named `output.txt`. Here's a detailed description of each part of the code:

### 1. **Header Files**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```
- `#include <stdio.h>`: Includes the Standard Input Output header file for functions related to input and output operations (e.g., `printf`, `fgets`, `fprintf`, `fopen`, `fclose`).
- `#include <stdlib.h>`: Includes the Standard Library header file for general utilities (e.g., `malloc`, `free`, `exit`). In this code, it's included but not strictly necessary as no functions from this header are used.

### 2. **Define Constants**
```c
#define MAX_INPUT_SIZE 100
```
- Defines a constant `MAX_INPUT_SIZE` with a value of 100, which specifies the maximum number of characters that the program will read from the user input.

### 3. **Main Function**
```c
int main() {
    char input[MAX_INPUT_SIZE];
    FILE *file;
```
- **`char input[MAX_INPUT_SIZE];`**: Declares an array `input` to hold the user's input with a size of 100 characters.
- **`FILE *file;`**: Declares a pointer `file` for handling file operations.

### 4. **Open File for Writing**
```c
file = fopen("output.txt", "w");
if (file == NULL) {
    perror("Error opening file");
    return 1;
}
```
- `fopen("output.txt", "w")`: Opens the file `output.txt` for writing. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If there is an error (e.g., permission issues), `fopen` returns `NULL`.
- **Error Handling**: If `fopen` fails, `perror("Error opening file")` prints an error message, and the program exits with a status of 1.

### 5. **Prompt and Read User Input**
```c
printf("Enter some text (max %d characters): ", MAX_INPUT_SIZE - 1);
if (fgets(input, MAX_INPUT_SIZE, stdin) == NULL) {
    perror("Error reading input");
    fclose(file);
    return 1;
}
```
- **Prompt Message**: `printf` displays a message asking the user to enter text, indicating the maximum number of characters allowed.
- **`fgets(input, MAX_INPUT_SIZE, stdin)`**: Reads a line of text from standard input (`stdin`) into the `input` array. It reads up to `MAX_INPUT_SIZE - 1` characters to leave space for the null terminator. If `fgets` fails (e.g., due to an input error), it prints an error message and closes the file before exiting with a status of 1.

### 6. **Write Input to File**
```c
fprintf(file, "%s", input);
```
- `fprintf(file, "%s", input)`: Writes the content of the `input` array to the file. The format specifier `%s` is used to write a string.

### 7. **Close File and End Program**
```c
fclose(file);
printf("Input saved to 'output.txt'.\n");
return 0;
```
- `fclose(file)`: Closes the file to ensure all data is properly saved and resources are released.
- **Completion Message**: `printf("Input saved to 'output.txt'.\n")` informs the user that their input has been successfully saved to the file.
- `return 0;`: Exits the program with a status of 0, indicating successful completion.

Overall, the program prompts the user for text input, writes it to a file, and handles errors that may occur during file operations or input reading.
